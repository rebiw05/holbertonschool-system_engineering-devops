# 2. Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

## Overview

A secure and monitored infrastructure that hosts `www.foobar.com` using:
- 1 Load Balancer
- 3 Backend Servers
- SSL encryption
- Firewalls and monitoring

## Components

- **Domain Name**: www.foobar.com  points to Load Balancer IP
- **Load Balancer**: SSL termination and request distribution
- **3 Servers**:
  - Web server (Nginx)
  - App server
  - Application code base
  - MySQL DB (1 Primary, 2 Read Replicas)
  - Monitoring agent (e.g., SumoLogic client)
  - Each protected by a dedicated firewall

## Security Features

- **Firewalls**: Only allow necessary traffic
- **SSL Certificate**: Enables HTTPS for encrypted traffic
- **Monitoring Agents**: Collect server metrics and logs

## Monitoring

- Agents send logs/metrics to tools like SumoLogic
- Data includes CPU, RAM, network, app logs, etc.
- Web server QPS monitored by exposing Nginx metrics

## Known Issues

### SSL Termination at Load Balancer
- If decrypted at the LB, traffic between LB and backend is plaintext
- Solution: Use TLS re-encryption from LB to backend

### Single MySQL Writer
- Only one DB handles writes risk of downtime
- Solution: DB failover or multi-master

### All Servers Have All Roles
- Mixing DB, web, and app roles causes resource competition and poor scalability
- Solution: Use dedicated servers for each role
