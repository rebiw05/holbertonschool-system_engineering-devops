# 1. Distributed Web Infrastructure

This design describes a distributed infrastructure for hosting the website `www.foobar.com`.

## Architecture Overview

- **Domain Name**: `foobar.com` with `www` subdomain pointing to the Load Balancer IP
- **Load Balancer**: HAProxy
  - Uses **Round Robin** algorithm
  - Distributes requests between two servers
- **2 Servers**:
  - Nginx (Web Server)
  - Application Server (PHP, Node.js, etc.)
  - Application Files
  - MySQL Database (Primary/Replica cluster)

## Load Balancer Configuration

- **Algorithm**: Round Robin
- **Setup**: Active-Active
  - Both servers serve traffic concurrently
  - Better performance and uptime

## Database Cluster

- **Primary Node (Server 1)**: Handles all **write** operations
- **Replica Node (Server 2)**: Handles **read** operations
- Replication keeps the Replica updated with the Primary

## Issues

### Single Point of Failure
- The Load Balancer is not redundant

### Security
- No HTTPS (unencrypted traffic)
- No firewall (open ports and services exposed)

### Monitoring
- No system health checks or alerts in place
